I’m excited to share my Week 2 project as part of my learning journey at Error Makes Clever Academy – a Trip Advisor Website built using HTML and CSS, made fully responsive for both mobile and laptop screens! 📱💻

This project taught me how a simple layout can transform into a beautiful and functional travel guide with the right blend of creativity and code. From designing clean UI sections to ensuring it looks good on all devices – every step was a learning curve that boosted my confidence! 💪

🛠️ Skills used:

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling

Media queries for responsive design

A pinch of creativity and lots of learning spirit 🎨✨

💡 Each project is not just code, it’s a reflection of growth, patience, and continuous improvement.

Looking forward to exploring more real-world concepts in the coming weeks!
